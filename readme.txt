== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Which 3D formats do you support?=
CustomizeMe supports 3D models in FBX OBJ and GLB format. You can use a 3D software program like Blender to convert other 3D file formats into these formats.

= What kind of products can be personalized? =
Any product you want can be. The standardized workflow of CustomizeMe allows any 3D model to be configured in real-time – whether your 3D model is a pen, a watch, or a complete building.

= How many variations can I add to one product? =
As much as you wish. A friendly word of warning, however. When you begin offering customization, we recommend keeping the number of options low as you find your feet.

= Do my customers or I need a unique AR app? =
No, you don’t need it. Your customers only need to allow the use of cameras by the device to launch the Augmented Reality features. 

= Does using CustomizeMe require installing any software on a computer or mobile device? =
No. All of our tools are browser-based. You can access them on any device any time you want.
